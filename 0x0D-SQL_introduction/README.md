# Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects related to relational databases. Each project explores different aspects of working with relational databases, including data organization, querying, and manipulation.

## Projects

### 1. Introduction to Relational Databases

In this project, we provide an introduction to relational databases. We explain the fundamental concepts, including tables, records, columns, and keys. We explore how data is organized within a relational database and how relationships between tables are established.

### 2. Data Modeling and Schema Design

In this project, we dive deeper into data modeling and schema design for relational databases. We discuss best practices for designing efficient and scalable database schemas. We cover topics such as normalization, denormalization, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.

### 3. Querying Relational Databases

This project focuses on querying relational databases using SQL (Structured Query Language). We cover various SQL statements, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. We explore complex queries involving multiple tables, filtering, sorting, and joining data.

### 4. Data Manipulation in Relational Databases

In this project, we explore advanced techniques for manipulating data in relational databases. We discuss transaction management, handling concurrency, and implementing data integrity constraints. We also cover techniques for bulk data operations and performance optimization.
