***Python Programming Language***
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for developing a variety of applications. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners and experts alike. It has a large standard library that provides support for many common programming tasks, such as working with data structures, regular expressions, networking, and more.

Python is also widely used in the field of data science and machine learning, thanks to its powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

Python is an open-source language, which means that its source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This has led to a large and active community of developers who have contributed to the development of the language and its many libraries and frameworks.
