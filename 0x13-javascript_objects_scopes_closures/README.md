## Introduction

In this repository, you will find JavaScript code examples and exercises that cover the following topics:

- Object-oriented programming with JavaScript
- Scopes and variable hoisting
- Closures and lexical scope
- Function prototypes and inheritance
- Manipulating objects and arrays
- Higher-order functions and callback functions
- Asynchronous JavaScript and promises

Each file focuses on a specific concept or task and provides examples and explanations to help you understand and practice JavaScript programming.

## File Descriptions

The repository consists of the following files:

1. [0-rectangle.js](./0-rectangle.js): An empty class `Rectangle`.
2. [1-rectangle.js](./1-rectangle.js): A class `Rectangle` with a constructor that initializes the `width` and `height` properties.
3. [2-rectangle.js](./2-rectangle.js): A class `Rectangle` with a constructor that only initializes the `width` and `height` properties if they are greater than 0.
4. [3-rectangle.js](./3-rectangle.js): A class `Rectangle` with a constructor and a method `print()` that prints a rectangle using the `X` character.
5. [4-rectangle.js](./4-rectangle.js): A class `Rectangle` with a constructor, methods `print()`, `rotate()`, and `double()`, which rotate the rectangle, double its dimensions, and print it respectively.
6. [5-square.js](./5-square.js): A class `Square` that extends the `Rectangle` class and initializes both the `width` and `height` properties to the same value.
7. [6-square.js](/6-square.js): A class `SquareWithCharPrint` that extends the `Square` class and adds a method `charPrint(c)` to print the square using a specific character.
8. [7-occurrences.js](./7-occurrences.js): A function `nbOccurences(list, searchElement)` that returns the number of occurrences of `searchElement` in `list`.
9. [8-esrever.js](./8-esrever.js): A function `esrever(list)` that returns a reversed version of `list`.
10. [9-logme.js](./9-logme.js): A function `logMe(item)` that prints an item and keeps track of the number of times it has been called.
11. [10-converter.js](./10-converter.js): A function `converter(base)` that returns a function that converts a number to the specified base.
12. [100-map.js](./100-map.js): Using the `map` function to create a new array based on the index.
13. [101-sorted.js](./101-sorted.js): Creating a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
14. [102-concat.js](./102-concat.js): Concatenating two files into a destination file.

Feel free to explore each file and refer to the code and comments for more details on each topic or task.
