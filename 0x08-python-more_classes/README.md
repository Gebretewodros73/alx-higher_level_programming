# 0x08-python-more_classes

This directory contains Python scripts that implement various tasks related to classes and objects.

## 0. Simple Rectangle

* File: [0-rectangle.py](./0-rectangle.py)
* Test: [0-main.py](./0-main.py)

An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

## 1. Real Definition of a Rectangle

* File: [1-rectangle.py](./1-rectangle.py)
* Test: [1-main.py](./1-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private attributes `width` and `height`. It has properties to retrieve and set these attributes.

## 2. Area and Perimeter

* File: [2-rectangle.py](./2-rectangle.py)
* Test: [2-main.py](./2-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It also has public methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

## 3. String Representation

* File: [3-rectangle.py](./3-rectangle.py)
* Test: [3-main.py](./3-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class can be printed using the '#' character for visualization.

## 4. Eval is Magic

* File: [4-rectangle.py](./4-rectangle.py)
* Test: [4-main.py](./4-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class supports the `repr()` function to recreate a new instance using `eval()`.

## 5. Detect Instance Deletion

* File: [5-rectangle.py](./5-rectangle.py)
* Test: [5-main.py](./5-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class prints a message when an instance is deleted.

## 6. How Many Instances

* File: [6-rectangle.py](./6-rectangle.py)
* Test: [6-main.py](./6-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class tracks the number of instances created.

## 7. Change Representation

* File: [7-rectangle.py](./7-rectangle.py)
* Test: [7-main.py](./7-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class allows changing the representation symbol.

## 8. Compare Rectangles

* File: [8-rectangle.py](./8-rectangle.py)
* Test: [8-main.py](./8-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class includes a static method to compare rectangles based on their area.

## 9. A Square is a Rectangle

* File: [9-rectangle.py](./9-rectangle.py)
* Test: [9-main.py](./9-main.py)

A class `Rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`. It has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The class includes a class method to create a new instance with equal width and height.

## 10. N Queens

* File: [101-nqueens.py](./101-nqueens.py)

A Python script that solves the N queens problem. It prints all possible solutions to the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage: `./101-nqueens.py N`

Where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4. If N is not provided or is invalid, the script will display appropriate error messages.
