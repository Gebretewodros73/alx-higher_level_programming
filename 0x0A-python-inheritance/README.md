###**Inheritance in Python**
Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class is called the subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called the superclass or base class.

In Python, inheritance is achieved by using the class keyword and specifying the base class in parentheses after the class name. The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class, and can also override or add new attributes and methods.

In this repository, we explore various examples of inheritance in Python, including:

	* Simple inheritance
	* Multiple inheritance
	* Method overriding
	* Calling superclass methods with **super()**
there are also tasks of how to use inheritance to create more complex data structures, such as linked lists and trees.

To learn more about inheritance in Python, please refer to the code tasks in this repository and the Python documentation.
